# Kanban Board:bar_chart:


## Project overview::clipboard:

The challenge was to build an app for a potential client who required Kanban solution similar to [this one](https://kanbanblog.com/explained/).
The user can use a Kanban board by adding, editing, and canceling tasks. Tasks are movable between the columns as well.
Every column has a limit for tasks that it can contain.
If the user reached the maximum number of tasks in a particular column it will not be possible to move another one to it or add a new one.
Data is saved in localStorage so the user can come back to the board as it was left before closing the web browser.
The technology is React with a strong accent to use React Hooks & Context.

## Installation:dvd:

The project uses node and npm. To run the app on your machine you should install all dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/FilipDrzazga/Kanban-Board.git

npm run start
```
